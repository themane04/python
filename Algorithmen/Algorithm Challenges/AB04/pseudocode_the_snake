Function Definition:
Define a function with a meaningful name.
It should accept one parameter, representing the side length of the square game screen.

Initialize Variables:
Create a variable for the snake's size, starting at 1 block.
Initialize a counter variable to track how many times the snake eats.

Total Blocks Calculation:
Calculate the total number of blocks on the game screen. This is the side length squared.

Eating Loop:
Use a loop to simulate the snake eating and growing.
Continue the loop until the snake's size is greater than or equal to the total blocks.

Inside the loop:
Double the snake's size (snake size *= 2).
Increment the eating counter.

Return the Result:
Once the snake fills the screen, exit the loop.
Return the counter indicating how many times the snake has eaten.

Function Testing:
Test the function with various side lengths to ensure accuracy.
