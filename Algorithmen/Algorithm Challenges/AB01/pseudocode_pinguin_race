Class Definition:
Define a class named PenguinRaceCalculator.
The constructor (__init__) should take two arguments: race_snapshot (a list of the current race positions) and
penguin_names (a list of the names of participating penguins).

Initialization:
Store the passed arguments in class variables.

Calculate Progress:
Inside the class, define a function calculate_progress.
This function calculates the progress for each penguin in race_snapshot, based on the number of calm ("-") and
turbulent ("~") waters preceding the penguin ("p").
Calm water contributes more to progress than turbulent water.

Determine Winners:
Define a function get_winners within the class.
Use calculate_progress to calculate each penguin's progress.
Rank the penguins based on their progress.

Format Winners:
The get_winners function should return the names of the penguins with the most progress in the format
"GOLD: [name], SILVER: [name], BRONZE: [name]".
Ensure the names are matched correctly to their progress from race_snapshot.
Handle More Than Three Penguins:

If there are more than three penguins, still only return the top three as winners.
