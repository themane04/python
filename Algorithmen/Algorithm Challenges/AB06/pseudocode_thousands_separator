Define a function named 'add_thousands_separator' which takes a number as its input:
    First, check if the input number is positive.
    If the number is not positive, return an error message.

    Convert the number into a string.

    Initialize an empty string to store the final result.

    Set a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of characters processed.

    Starting from the end of the number string, iterate over each character:
        Append the current character to the beginning of the result string.

        Increase the counter by one.

        Check if the counter is a multiple of three and the character is not the first character in the number string:
            If true, insert a separator symbol (like an apostrophe or comma) at the beginning of the result string.

    Once all characters are processed, return the result string as the output.

End of the function.
