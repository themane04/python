This Python module, offered by my company, featured a variety of exercises designed to enhance my understanding of Python. The curriculum covered everything from fundamental syntax and data types to advanced topics such as defining functions, implementing control structures, and managing error handling. Each exercise was crafted to build upon the previous, progressively deepening my knowledge and skills in Python programming.

The whole module was about a week long, but we worked on the exercises everytime we had some free time. There are some interesting exercises even some games.

## Games

All games developed during the module can be found [here](Tag-7-8/exercise_10). You're invited to try them and see how they work. Enjoy the gameplay!

## Algorithm Challenges

Our coach also provided us with a series of algorithm challenges to test our problem-solving skills. You can explore these challenges [here](Algorithmen). They're a great way to see practical applications of the concepts we learned.

## Other Exercises

The remaining directories within this repository contain daily exercises assigned by our coach. These tasks covered a wide range of topics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of Python programming. Each set of exercises built on the last, progressively enhancing our skills and knowledge.
